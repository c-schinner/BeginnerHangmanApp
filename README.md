# BeginnerHangmanApp
This is my first hangman game, very simple using the random module and picking a word from a list.
Our game gives the user a certain amount of tries before they lose the game.
Simple if/elif statements to veryify the users letter guess, aswell as keeping track of the correct letters and incorrect letters and displaying them for the user to view.
